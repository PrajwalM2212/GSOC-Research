## Oragnization in focus
- [coala](https://github.com/coala/coala)
- [Project Link](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=optimize_caching&lang=en)

## Potential Bottlenecks
- The use of `cPickle` instead of `pickle` in `CachingUtilities.py` for object serialization can potentially boost performance significantly for large projects.

## Notes
### Performance optimization
- Loading bears takes times and can be improved using cib. Reference: [this issue](https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/2912#issuecomment-261551204)
- Bear loading needs to be improved
- `yield_once` takes a lot of CPU time. It can be found in **coala_utils.decoraters**, **Collectors.py**, **Importers.py** and **Globbing.py**. Performance can be optimized by not using `yield_once` in cases where we expect all distinct results (without any duplication) will be yielded.
- Significant files and packages of interest **coalib.misc.CachingUtilities**, **coalib/processes/Processing.py**, **coalib/misc/Caching.py**  and **coala_main.py**.
- Need to read **RELEASE_NOTES.rst** and **coalib/parsing/DefaultArgParser.py**.
- Need to look at some standard libraries that might be useful: **hashlib**, **pickle**, etc.

### Additional points to include in the proposal
- A benchmarking tool using VMProf API or low level profiling and a custom flag for coala to run analysis and option to check for bears individually and Integrate it with CIs used by coala. See [issue](https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/3914)
